1. Detect the member that have invalid email address		
	- where to detect? in checkbounce service or maybe a new services
		- we can set the amount of hard bounce times for detect in appsetting
		- some how, when the user have change the email.should we mark the old data.and how to deal with it
	- use a flag column in member table seems good 
	- the mailqueue table column [ToAddress] [BccAddress] maybe more than one,must split for [;].
2. Add error for member homepage when member has the invalid email address flag
	- have a button or link in the error message to jump into account for edit email address
		- maybe we need to change the account.aspx for enter to make the tab for email be open for this jump


	>some thing to ask,
	>>a member have change the email ,the next log in must use newest email?
	>>the notification page only affect email sending? if it will affect in site messages .what should do ~

3. Change the notification page .make it all be gray(or something else) when member has invalid email address flag
	-    <del> seems we have EmailPermission table .maybe when we set the email flag we can set this table all to 0,not edit the member table.does it works? </del>  
	- maybe we can modify the property of member.cs .use the flag in it .when flag is true. we return false always .in this way no need to edit email sending code
